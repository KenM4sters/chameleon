        <p class="about_description">
            Hi! My name is Samuel Brookman, and I'm a developing software engineer currently looking for career
            opportunities within the UK.

        <p class="about_description">
            As you can probably tell from my projects, my programming experience lies very heavily with graphics rendering using systems languages
            like C, C++ and more recently Rust, along with various different graphics APIs.

            This portfolio has been built entirely by myself using my own WebGL2.0 rendering framework, Chameleon, which
            you can learn more about by clickling on its card.
