                Hi! My name is Samuel Brookman, and I'm a developing software engineer currently looking for career
                opportunities within the UK.  
            </p>
            <p class="about_description">
                As you can probably tell from my projects, my programming experience lies very heavily with graphics rendering using systems languages
                like C, C++ and more recently Rust, along with various different graphics APIs, although I've always maintained a strong interest in web development since programming for the first time.

            <p class="about_description">
                What I find the most enjoyable about programming is solving complex problems with simple solutions. With my free time, I mostly decide
                to develop open-source libraries that provide a simplified abstraction over some underlying idea/framework, whether it be 
                maths, physics, graphics or web related.

                This portfolio has been built entirely by myself using my own WebGL2.0 rendering framework, Chameleon, which
                you can learn more about by clickling on its project card.
